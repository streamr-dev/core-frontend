## Intro to Core

<Link to={links.userpages.main}>Core</Link> is the collection of [open source](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-platform), Streamr developed and supported applications that help you create, process, visualise and sell your realtime data. 

Essentially, Core contains the UI toolkits for working with Streams, Canvases, Dashboards, and Products on the Streamr Platform.

All you need to get started using <Link to={links.userpages.main}>Core</Link> is a <Link to={links.internalLogin}>Streamr Account</Link>.
