## Intro to Core

Streamr <Link to={links.userpages.main}>Core</Link> is the collection of open source applications developed and supported by Streamr that help you create, process, visualise and sell your realtime data. 

Essentially, Core is the UI toolkit for working with Streams, Canvases, Dashboards, and Products on the Streamr Platform.

All you need to get started using <Link to={links.userpages.main}>Core</Link> is a <Link to={links.newdocs.gettingStarted}>Streamr Account</Link>.
