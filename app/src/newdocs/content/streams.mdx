## Work with streams via SDKs

The easiest way to work with streams is to use the JavaScript client, which works in `node.js` as well as the browser. See the <Link to={links.newdocs.SDKs}>SDKs section</Link> for the official and community-maintained client libraries available for various languages:

- **JavaScript** client works in the browser as well as node.js.
- **Java** client is work-in-progress but already implements the most important set of functionality.

Client libraries for other languages are on the <a href={links.community.trello} target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">roadmap</a>. If a client library isn't available for your language, you can dive into the details of the [websocket protocol](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-protocol-js/blob/bb2f0168bcff454b5c458e275e9c2de0dee342f9/PROTOCOL.md).

If you'd like to contribute a client library and get it listed here, please get in touch on <a href={links.community.telegram} target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Telegram</a>, <a href={links.community.reddit} target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> or <a href={links.contact.general} rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">email</a>!

### Authentication

When reading from or writing to Streams, you need to provide a session token or an API key, or login with an Ethereum account. To read more about API keys or obtaining a session token, refer to the <Link to={links.newdocs.api}>Authentication section of the API documentation</Link>.

### Creating a client instance with API key

**Javascript**

<CodeSnippet language='javascript'>{CreateJavascriptClient}</CodeSnippet>

**Java**

<CodeSnippet language='java'>{CreateJavaClient}</CodeSnippet>

### Subscribing to real-time events in a stream

By subscribing to Streams, your application gets immediately notified about new events in the Stream. 

**JavaScript**

<CodeSnippet language='javascript'>{SubscribeJavascriptClient}</CodeSnippet>

**Java**

<CodeSnippet language='java'>{SubscribeJavaClient}</CodeSnippet>

### Publishing events to Streams

JavaScript:

<CodeSnippet language='javascript'>{PublishJavascriptClient}</CodeSnippet>

Java:

Events in Streams are key-value pairs, represented in Java as Map objects. Below is an example of creating an event payload and publishing it into a Stream:

<CodeSnippet language='java'>{PublishJavaClient}</CodeSnippet>
