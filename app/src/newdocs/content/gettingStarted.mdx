## Before you start... 

Welcome to Streamr!

Here's everything you'll need to get up and running on the platform. 

The first thing you'll probably want to do is get a Streamr account. You can do that <Link to={links.internalLogin}>here</Link>. Creating an account requires either an E-mail address or a Web3 Ethereum wallet, e.g. <a href="https://metamask.io">Metamask</a>.

## Obtain API keys

After creating your Streamr account, visit your <Link to={links.userpages.profile}>profile settings page</Link> to reveal your API keys. These keys grant you access to read and write to the Streams you create and <Link to={links.newdocs.api}>lots more</Link>.
