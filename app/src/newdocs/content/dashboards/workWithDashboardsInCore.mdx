## Work with dashboards in Core

To create a new dashboard, click on **Create Dashboard** inside the <Link to={links.userpages.dashboards}>dashboards page</Link>, inside the Core app.

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, dashboardStyles.createDashboard)}>
  <img src={CreateDashboard} />
</div>

On the <Link to={links.userpages.dashboards}>dashboards page</Link> you'll see preview tiles of your dashboards which you can search and sort by their name. Dashboards don't have a running state- the modules inside the dashboard will reflect the realtime data flow of the canvas modules inside it. When there is no realtime data, the dashboard modules will appear empty.

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, dashboardStyles.dashboardListing)}>
  <img src={DashboardListing} />
</div>

When you're happy with your dashboard, you can embed live visualisation elements in external web pages.
