Listen to MQTT messages, output them as strings. If message is JSON, a JsonParser module can be used to transform the string into a map, and GetMultiFromMap module to extract values from the map.  


## Examples:

### Connecting to MQTT service without certificate
Give URL address as  


```
mqtt://service.com
```
or  


```
tcp://service.com
```
Add topic and username and password if needed.  


### Connecting to MQTT with certificate
Give URL address as  


```
ssl://service.com
```
Add topic and username and password if needed.  

Select certificate type to be .crt and paste your certificate to text area.
