Call Ethereum smart contract.  

First, connect Ethereum contract into **contract** input. You can write your own using SolidityModule, or pick a template such as PayByUse.  

Second, choose the **function** you want to call from the dropdown. There are two kinds of functions calls:  


- constant function calls that return results directly, and- transactions that return values through events that the function call invokes.
The contract must be deployed before this module can activate.
