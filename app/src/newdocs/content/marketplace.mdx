## Introduction to the Marketplace
The <Link to={links.marketplace.main}>Marketplace</Link> is an application that enables users to buy and sell access to real-time data content on the Streamr Network. The Marketplace is filled with both paid and free products, offering data producers an opportunity to either monetise their data or make it freely available to everyone. Products have time-based subscription periods, and the currency used on the Marketplace is the <Link to={links.newdocs.dataToken}>DATA token</Link>.

The Marketplace is an [open source](http://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-platform) project that builds on the [Streamr Network](https://streamr.com/network) and the [Ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org). Ethereum is used to store a registry of data products, coordinate access to them, and to provide a secure ledger of value transactions. Products are published to the [Marketplace smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa10151d088f6f2705a05d6c83719e99e079a61c1), and the contract allows data buyers to directly transact with sellers using the DATA token, removing all traditionally present middlemen and their fees. All of the data on the Marketplace is delivered peer-to-peer via the Streamr Network.
