## Introduction to the Marketplace
The [Marketplace](https://streamr.com/marketplace) is an application that enables users to buy and sell access to real-time data content on the Streamr Network. The Marketplace is filled with both paid and free products, offering data producers an opportunity to either monetise their data or make it freely available to everyone. Products have time-based subscription periods, and the currency used on the Marketplace is the <Link to={links.newdocs.dataToken}>DATA token</Link>.

The marketplace is an [open source](http://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-platform) project that works with the [Ethereum network](https://www.ethereum.org). The Ethereum network is used to coordinate access to a product's data and to provide the ledger of transactions. Products are deployed to the Ethereum network and payments are made through the [marketplace smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa10151d088f6f2705a05d6c83719e99e079a61c1). These payments are direct, buyer to seller transactions of the DATA token without a middleman fee. All of the data on the marketplace is transported via the [Streamr network](https://streamr.com/network).
