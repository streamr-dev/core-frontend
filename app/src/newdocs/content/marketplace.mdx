## Introduction to the Marketplace
The [marketplace](https://streamr.com/marketplace) is a Streamr developed application that facilitates the buying and selling of real-time data on the Streamr platform. The marketplace is filled with both free products and products created by data producers that wish to monetise their data. The currency of the marketplace is the <Link to={links.newdocs.dataToken}>DATA token</Link>.

The marketplace is an [open source](http://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-platform) project that's integrated with the [Ethereum blockchain](https://www.ethereum.org) to coordinate payments and provide the ledger of transactions. Products are deployed to the blockchain and payments are facilitated via the [marketplace smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa10151d088f6f2705a05d6c83719e99e079a61c1). These payments are direct, peer-to-peer (buyer to seller) transactions of the DATA token without a middleman fee. All of the data on the marketplace is transported via the [Streamr Network](https://streamr.com/network).
