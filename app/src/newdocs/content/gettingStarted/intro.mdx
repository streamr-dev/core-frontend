**Welcome to Streamr!**

To get a feel for what Streamr is, checkout our <Link to={links.newdocs.introduction}>intro docs</Link>.

The first thing you'll want to get is a Streamr account. You can do that <Link to={links.internalLogin}>here</Link>. Creating an account requires either an Email address or a Web3 Ethereum wallet, e.g. <a href="https://metamask.io" target="blank">Metamask</a>.
