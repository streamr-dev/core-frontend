## Work with canvases in Core

To create a new canvas, click on **Create Canvas** on the <Link to={links.userpages.canvases}>canvas listing</Link> page.

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, canvasesStyles.createCanvasButton)}>
  <img src={CreateCanvasButton} />
</div>

You'll see all of your canvases along with their running state on the canvases listing page - click on a canvas preview tile to open it in the editor. You can also search and sort your canvases by their name, when they were modified, or from their running state. 

<div className={docsStyles.centered}>
  <img src={CoreListing} />
</div>

Hover your mouse over the canvas preview tile to discover extra things you can do with your canvas such as sharing it with friends or the public.

<div className={docsStyles.centered}>
  <img src={CanvasTile} />
</div>
