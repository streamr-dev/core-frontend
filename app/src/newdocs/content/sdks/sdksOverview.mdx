## Overview
There are both official and unofficial Software Development Kits (SDKs) available for building software that interacts
with the Streamr platform. Using an SDK provides an effortless and reliable way to use Streamr from your software
projects. The SDKs take care of the small details required to interact with Streamr through intuitive API libraries, allowing a
developer to focus on their task at hand.


Currently, we provide official SDKs for JavaScript (browser and Node.js) and Java. There is also a community-built SDK for
Python in the works. The range of features each of these SDKs provide may vary; be sure to check the documentation of
the specific SDK for more information.

If your programming language or software environment of choice does not have an SDK available, you can still interact
with Streamr using our <Link to={links.newdocs.api}>JSON-based HTTP API</Link> .
