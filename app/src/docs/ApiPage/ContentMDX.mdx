# Introduction to the Streamr API
Streamr provides a set of APIs to enable easy integration with other systems. The APIs cover data input, data output, and managing various resources within Streamr (such as Canvases, Dashboards, and Streams).

There are RESTful HTTP endpoints that can be accessed using any HTTP library with ease. Streaming data output is available over websockets. For easy usage, we offer a Javascript client that works in the browser as well as node.js. The client is available on npm. Clients for other languages are coming soon.

### Authentication
You authenticate to all the RESTful API endpoints using your user API key, found on your profile page. Include the following header on your HTTP request:

When reading from or writing to Streams, you can use a Stream-specific anonymous key instead of your user key to avoid exposing it. Anonymous keys can be managed on the Stream edit page.

### Data Input via HTTP
You can write events to streams by POSTing JSON objects to the below API endpoint. The body of the request should be a JSON object, encoded in UTF-8, containing the key-value pairs representing your data. You can also send a JSON list (of objects), if you want to push multiple events in one HTTP request (they will all get the same timestamp).

#### Endpoint

##### Highlight box bg-color padded 

Note that the stream id is part of the URL.

#### Authentication
See the section on [authentication](https://www.auth.com).

#### Options
Options for the data input can be provided in query parameters:

    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Parameter</th>
            <th>Required</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>ttyl</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>
                Time-To-Live, in seconds. The event will be deleted after this time has passed. If not given, the event storage period will be the stream default.    
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>pkey</td>
            <td>No</td>
            <td>
                For partitioned streams, provides the key to partition by. Can be eg. a customer id to make all events for that customer to go to the same Canvas for  processing. If not given, a random partition is selected.
            </td>
        </tr>

### Data Output
There are two APIs for requesting data from Streamr into external applications: our websocket-based streaming API, and our RESTful HTTP API.

The streaming API can be used to control external applications using realtime events from Streamr. For example, you could push realtime stock prices into a mobile app, or update player positions in a multiplayer game. Or you could implement a thermostat by controlling warming or cooling based on a temperature measurement. The streaming API pushes new events to subscribed clients immediately when they become available. For easy usage of the streaming API, we offer a Javascript client that works in the browser as well as node.js. Clients for other languages are coming soon.

#### Streamr Javascript Client
By using this client, you can easily subscribe to realtime Streamr streams from Javascript-based environments, such as browsers and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). This enables you to use Streamr as an over-the-internet pub/sub engine with powerful analytics and automation features.

The client uses websockets for streaming message delivery. It should work in all modern browsers.

#### Installation
The client is available on npm and can be installed simpy by:

#### Usage
Here's a quick example. More detailed examples for the browser and node.js can be found here.
