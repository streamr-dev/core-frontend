# Getting Started
Processing raw data needs an Engine because it needs to be aggregated, filtered, or combined with other data to extract its value. Our Engine is built to deal with high volumes of information and accept data from a wide variety of sources including financial exchanges, IoT devices and social media.

### Create a stream
In this tutorial you will learn how to send real-time data to Streams that exist on the Streamr Network. You will use the UI to create a Stream, then send data points to it using the Streamr JavaScript client library. We’ll also take a look at how to do the same from any language by making the API calls directly.

### Get your Stream ID
From here, click Create Stream. You will be taken to the stream Setup view.  First you need to name your stream and write a basic description. The Stream ID will be created for you. Click to copy the ID to clipboard. You’ll need this in order to produce events to your stream via the API. Click Save and Exit to return to your User Page.
