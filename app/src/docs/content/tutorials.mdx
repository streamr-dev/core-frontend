Node.js library for easily getting data from Ruuvi sensors to Streamr.

This library simply acts as glue between the Bluetooth sensors and the Streamr API. It listens to data from defined sensor tags, and produces the data to Streamr streams. It will also automatically create and configure the streams if they do not exist.

#### Installation
The library can be installed to your project via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ruuvi-streamr):

<CodeSnippet language='javascript' wrapLines>npm install ruuvi-streamr --save</CodeSnippet>

#### Usage
All you need to do is define a mapping from your tag IDs to a name and description, which are used to lookup or create the streams. You also need a Streamr API key which you can create in [user settings](https://www.streamr.com/profile/edit). The library will print to console warnings about undefined tags, allowing you to discover the IDs of your tags if you don’t have them yet.

#### Tips for Raspberry Pi
Our RuuviTag demo streams are powered by a Raspberry Pi 3 running Raspbian Linux. The library should also run fine on at least macOS, on which it has been developed.

On the Raspberry Pi, we had to give the following commands to enable listening to Bluetooth as a non-root user:

<CodeSnippet language='javascript' showLineNumbers wrapLines>{ruuviCommands}</CodeSnippet>

In this repository there is also an [example systemd service config](https://github.com/streamr-dev/ruuvi-streamr/blob/master/example.service), which helps set the node process run automatically on boot.

#### Use Case
The Streamr Engine makes it easy to refine the data and connect results to Ethereum smart contracts in real-time. To illustrate this, we implemented a little cold chain insurance example.

Below you can see the live canvas, embedded onto this blog. You can also [open it in the Editor via this link](https://www.streamr.com/canvas/embed/1fuzzyBPQ4Gcrc9DFF7RVwgEe-iMo-RcChQjFegumjrA).

Millions of tons of frozen foods are transported around the world everyday. So ensuring that foods remain frozen whilst in transit is really important for the end consumer. No one wants to buy defrosted then refrozen ice cream and restaurants don’t want to be cooking meat infested with bacteria. So in our scenario, a “courier” places a stake in ETH into a smart contract. If the measured temperature exceeds an agreed threshold (in the demo, 10°C), a penalty is subtracted from the stake and sent to the “beneficiary”.

In this simple demo, the Streamr Engine calculates a one-hour rolling average temperature and reports it (once every hour) to the smart contract. This demonstrates how the Streamr Engine can be used to easily build data processing oracles, reporting the calculation results to smart contracts.

We believe this is a really great (though small scale) example of machine-to-machine verification and payment.

## Cold Chain Monitoring

This demo is built around the pattern of a transportation company carrying refrigerated goods. It’s a pretty common use case around the world. We want to give clients a solution to monitor the journey of their products in a lightweight way. But this is not just about monitoring. They will also be allowed to set penalties in case the temperature inside the truck goes above a certain threshold – therefore spoiling the frozen food inside. And these penalties can be automatically paid out using pre-agreed smart contracts, saving time and money for all parties.

Below is a video tutorial to walk you through this demo:

  - Head to Remix IDE to deploy your smart contract. Here is a quick tutorial on how to use Remix.
  - Link to our deployed Cold Chain Monitoring smart contract
  - Link to our ERC20 token deployed contract

**3. Create Streamr canvas to interact with realtime data stream and smart contract**
  - Here is the link to the canvas we have used for demo
  - Remember to change the GetContractAt module smart contract address with your deployed contract address
  - You can add Ethereum accounts in your Streamr Profile by pasting the private key from your Metamask account (IMPORTANT: use only expendable accounts, not your real personal one)
  - Here is the link to the NodeJs library we used to push Ruuvi tag sensor data to Streamr Network via Raspberry Pi

## Integrating Google Fitness

[Streamr Marketplace](https://marketplace.streamr.com/) is a global data exchange platform offering easy integration APIs. In the Marketplace, any application can easily setup a stream to exchange/monetize data such as weather condition, traffic status and personal fitness for example.

One very important note is that data can be anonymised before being pushed to Marketplace, so privacy is not violated. This blog post will showcase how to integrate Google Fitness sensors data into the Streamr Marketplace so you can sell that information to potential buyers!

#### Preparations

- **Get a Google Account**: To use the Fitness REST API, you need a [Google Account](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount). If you already have an account, then you’re all set.
- **Get a Streamr Account**: If you do not have a Streamr account, please sign up [here](https://www.streamr.com/register/signup).
- **Download the Google Fit APP**: You need a smartphone with the [Google Fit APP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.fitness&hl=en) to record data such as daily steps, calories, heartbeat, weight and other information. (Note: type of data available will depend on the sensors owned by each individual user)

#### Getting Started
I. Request a Google OAuth 2.0 client ID
To use the Google Fit REST API, you need an OAuth 2.0 client ID for Web or Android applications. Follow these steps to request a Google OAuth 2.0 client ID for the Fitness API.

- Go to the [Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=fitness).
- It will prompt to create a project if you don’t have one already or select an existing one. (Note: use the same project for the Android and REST versions of your app.)
- Click **Continue** to enable the Fitness API.
- Click **Go to credentials**.
- Click **New credentials**, then select **OAuth Client ID**. If it is the first time setting up OAth, you might need to **Configure consent screen**
- When creating the new OAth Client ID, under **Application type** select **Web application**.
- Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, enter the base URL of the site from which requests will originate (for example **https://developers.google.com** is the URL used by the OAuth Playground).
- Under **Authorized redirect URI**, enter the URL (for example **https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground** is the URL used by the OAuth Playground).

<img src={GoogleApi} />

- Click Create. Your new OAuth 2.0 Client ID and secret appear in the list of IDs for your project. An OAuth 2.0 Client ID is a string of characters, something like this:

<CodeSnippet language='javascript' wrapLines>
    780816631155-gbvyo1o7r2pn95qc4ei9d61io4uh48hl.apps.googleusercontent.com
</CodeSnippet>

### II. Request the Google access token and refresh token

An access token is a credential that can be used by an application to access an API. A refresh token can be used to obtain a renewed access token when the access token has expired. To request the tokens, you can authorize the Fitness REST API in the OAuth Playground:

- Go to the [Google OAuth Playground](https://developers.google.com/oauthplayground/).
- Under Step 1 Select & authorize APIs, expand Fitness v1 and select the Fitness scopes to use.
- Click the **Setting** button, select **Use your own OAuth credentials**, and input yourself **Client ID** and **Client secret**.

<img src={GoogleDev} />

- Click the Authorize APIs button, select the Google API Console project to use, and click Allow when prompted. You will be able to access and modify data associated with the selected Google API Console account.

<img src={GoogleAuth} />

- Click the **Exchange authorization code for tokens** button.
- After that, you will get the **access token** and **refresh token**, please write them down.

<img src={OauthPlay} />

### III. Create a Streamr stream
Using the aforementioned access token, client ID and secret, you can get Google Fitness Data in the type of JSON object. To upload the data to the Streamr, you need to create a stream in the Streamr Network. The stream (topic) is an ordered sequence of events (timestamped data points). Event payloads are JSON objects, or in other words, a set of key-value pairs. You can find the tutorial how to create a stream here. After that, please write down the **Stream ID** and **API Keys**.

### IV. Run the python script
Please copy the following code to your host, replace the **$YOUR_LOGFILE_PATH**, **$YOUR_STREAM_ID**, **$YOUR_API_KEY**, **$YOUR_CLIENT_ID**, **$YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET**, **$YOUR_REFERSH_TOKEN** with yours, and keep running the script for live data to appear in a stream. Note that, this particular script has been coded in python 2.7. If you use python 3.x or other script languages, you will need to re-code it first.

<CodeSnippet language='python' showLineNumbers wrapLines>{pythonScript}</CodeSnippet>

Unless an error has occurred, you should be able to see your personal data in the stream!

<img src={DataStream} />

### V. Publish the stream to the Streamr Marketplace
To sell your Google Fitness Data on the Streamr Marketplace, you can follow the tutorial called “Creating a Product for the Streamr Data Marketplace”. It is important to keep in mind not to send any personal identifiable data to the Marketplace in order to protect users’ privacy right.
