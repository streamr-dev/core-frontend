## What is Streamr?

Streamr is an open source, crowdfunded, decentralized platform for realtime data. At its heart is the <Link to={links.site.network}>Streamr Network</Link>, which transports <Link to={links.docs.streams}>streams</Link> of messages from data publishers to subscribers, appearing to the user as a global publish/subscribe messaging service.

It is similar in functionality to message queues, enterprise messaging systems, MQTT brokers, Apache Kafka, or pub/sub cloud messaging services. The key features of such systems, including Streamr, are:

- Publishing messages in order to make them available to subscribers
- Subscribing to messages in order to process them as they occur
- Storing messages for later use

You can interact with Streamr using the <Link to={links.docs.core}>Core</Link> user interface, <Link to={links.docs.SDKs}>SDKs</Link>, or directly via the <Link to={links.docs.api}>API</Link>.

In addition to the Network, the Streamr stack includes a <Link to={links.docs.marketplace}>Marketplace</Link> for data sharing and monetization, and <Link to={links.docs.canvases}>Canvases</Link> for data processing and analytics as part of the Core web app.

Using the built-in tooling is optional, as Streamr also integrates with many popular data frameworks including <a target="_blank" href={links.blogPosts.spark}>Apache Spark</a> and <a target="_blank" href={links.blogPosts.nodered}>Node-RED</a>.

To start using Streamr right away, check out the <Link to={links.docs.gettingStarted}>Getting Started</Link> section and the <Link to={links.docs.tutorials}>Tutorials.</Link>

## Why use Streamr?

The big difference to comparable data frameworks is that Streamr aims to be *decentralized* and *peer-to-peer*. There are plenty of advantages to decentralization:

- Similar to cloud services, you get on-demand scalability, minimal up-front investment, and benefit from economies of scale
- Unlike cloud services, there's no vendor lock-in, no monopolies, no proprietary code, and no need to trust a third party with your data
- Security: resilience to attacks and disruptions due to distributed and peer-to-peer nature
- Network effects: as adoption grows, the above points become stronger, a shared standard is formed across industries, and a lot of useful content becomes available from a single source

Instead of a centralized party, the Network is run by its community of users, and it heavily relies on cryptography to remove the need for trust. This creates a permissionless and neutral network for realtime data, which is highly suitable for use cases such as data sharing, data monetisation, and the <a target="_blank" href={links.external.decentralizedWeb}>decentralised web</a>, extending the capabilities of the underlying internet without compromising its open and decentralised nature.

Another major difference is that Streamr utilizes a companion blockchain, currently <a target="_blank" href={links.external.ethereum}>Ethereum</a>. The blockchain provides users with secure digital identities, enables direct transfers of value in the form of a Streamr-specific cryptocurrency <Link to={links.docs.dataToken}>DATA</Link>, and provides a shared ground truth for the network nodes.

## Work in Progress

While Streamr already works today, it is not yet feature-complete or fully decentralized. It is being very actively developed towards decentralization, node incentives, and new features. Learn more about the roadmap on the <a target="_blank" href={process.env.PLATFORM_ORIGIN_URL}>project website</a>.
