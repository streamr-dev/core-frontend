# Introduction to dashboards

Dashboards are a window into your running canvases. They provide a unique workspace for visualisation of the the live data sourced from any of your running <Link to={links.userpages.canvases}>canvases</Link>.

<img
  src={DashboardOutput}
  srcSet={`${DashboardOutput2x} 2x`}
  alt="Dashboard in action"
/>

To build a dashboard you need to first have a running canvas that uses a **Chart**, **Table** or **Geo Map** module. These modules (and their data flow) will be made available to you inside any dashboard you create. You can add the visualisation modules to the dashboard through the **module browser** at any time (even when your canvases are not running). They will activate once the canvas is running and data flows through those visualisation modules.

<div className={dashboardStyles.dashboardBrowser}>
  <img
    src={DashboardBrowser}
    srcSet={`${DashboardBrowser2x} 2x`}
    alt="Dashboard browser"
  />
</div> 

You can combine data from different canvases inside the same dashboard. For example, you may want to have a split screen of weather data and traffic information, sourced from different canvases.
