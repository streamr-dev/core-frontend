# Introduction to dashboards
Dashboards are a window into your running canvases. They provide a unique workspace for visualisation of the the live data sourced from any of your running <Link to={routes.canvases.index()}>canvases</Link>.

<Image
  src={DashboardOutput}
  highResSrc={DashboardOutput2x}
  alt="Dashboard in action"
/>

To build a dashboard you need to first have a running canvas that uses a **Chart**, **Table** or **Geo Map** module. These modules (and their data flow) will be made available to you inside any dashboard you create. You can add the visualisation modules to the dashboard through the **module browser** at any time (even when your canvases are not running). They will activate once the canvas is running and data flows through those visualisation modules.

  src={DashboardBrowser}
  highResSrc={DashboardBrowser2x}
  alt="Dashboard browser"
/>

You can combine data from different canvases inside the same dashboard. For example, you may want to have a split screen of weather data and traffic information, sourced from different canvases.

## Work with dashboards in Core
To create a new dashboard, click on <span className={docsStyles.streamrHighlight}>Create Dashboard</span> in Core > <Link to={routes.dashboards.index()}>Dashboards</Link>. Youâ€™ll be taken to the dashboard editor, which looks a bit similar to the canvas editor.

<Image

  src={CreateDashboard}
  highResSrc={CreateDashboard2x}
  alt="Create dashboard"
/>

On the <Link to={routes.dashboards.index()}>dashboards page</Link> you'll see preview tiles of your dashboards which you can search and sort by their name. Dashboards don't have a running state, the modules inside the dashboard will instead reflect the real-time data flow of the canvas modules inside it. When there is no real-time data, the dashboard modules will appear empty.

As with canvases, click the + icon to hide or show the module browser. You can also drag to resize each dashboard module to your liking. Hide or show dashboard modules by clicking them in the module browser. When you're happy with your dashboard, you can embed live dashboard modules in external web pages.
