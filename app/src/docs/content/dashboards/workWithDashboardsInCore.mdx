## Work with dashboards in Core

To create a new dashboard, click on <span className={docsStyles.streamrHighlight}>Create Dashboard</span> in Core > <Link to={links.userpages.dashboards}>Dashboards</Link>. You’ll be taken to the dashboard editor, which looks a bit similar to the canvas editor.

<img
  src={CreateDashboard}
  srcSet={`${CreateDashboard2x} 2x`}
  alt="Create dashboard"
/>

On the <Link to={links.userpages.dashboards}>dashboards page</Link> you'll see preview tiles of your dashboards which you can search and sort by their name. Dashboards don't have a running state, the modules inside the dashboard will instead reflect the realtime data flow of the canvas modules inside it.  When there is no realtime data, the dashboard modules will appear empty.

As with canvases, click the + icon to hide or show the module browser. You can also drag to resize each dashboard module to your liking. Hide or show dashboard modules by clicking them in the module browser. When you're happy with your dashboard, you can embed live dashboard modules in external web pages.
