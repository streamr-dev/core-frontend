# Roles and responsibilities
Each Data Union has one Admin (owner), and potentially thousands or even millions of data producing members.

### Admin
Admins have the power to add and remove members. They are responsible for maintaining their Data Unions, including ensuring good data quality and removing members that are not contributing data as they're expected to.

Admins are incentivized to perform this work by the Admin fee parameter, a fraction of the incoming Data Union revenue. Admins have control over this fee parameter, and members agree to it by joining the Data Union. Previous earnings are not affected by changes in the Admin fee.

Typically, Admins are initially the creators of both the user application and the Data Union, though this role can be assigned to someone else or even performed by the members themselves via a DAO.

### Members
Members are the people and/or devices that produce data into the data streams contained inside the Data Union. After joining, they start receiving a share of the revenue that accumulates in the Data Union contract. The main source of this revenue is likely to come from Marketplace subscriptions.

Members are identified by an Ethereum address, and they join the Data Union using the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamr-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streamr client</a>.
