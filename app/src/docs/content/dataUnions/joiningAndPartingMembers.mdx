# Joining and parting members

### Member joins
A member can join a Data Union by calling `join` using the Streamr Client library. This call is answered by a centralized gatekeeping service, currently run by Streamr, but can be replaced by your own gatekeeping service. Joining does not incur a gas fee if the default client settings are used. 

The typical way for a device or member to join the Data Union is via shared secrets. See <Link to={docsLinks.creatingADataUnion}>Creating a Data Union</Link> for details on creating a shared secret. Calling `join` with a valid secret will allow the member to join immediately:

```
const dataUnion = await streamr.getDataUnion(dataUnionAddress)
await dataUnion.join(secret)
```

### Removing a member
To remove (part) members, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/streamr-dev/network-monorepo/blob/main/packages/client/README.md#admin-functions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Union Admin API documentation</a>.
