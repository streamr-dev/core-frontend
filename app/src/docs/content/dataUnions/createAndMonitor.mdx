# Create and monitor Data Unions

### Creating a Data Union
A Data Union is typically created in the Core app. See <Link to={docsLinks.dataUnionsInCore}>Creating a Data Union with Core</Link> for more details. It can also be achieved programmatically, via a client library. Deploying a Data Union requires gas.

To get a DataUnion instance, call streamr.getDataUnion(dataUnionAddress).
```
const dataUnion = await streamr.getDataUnion(dataUnionAddress)
```

To deploy a new DataUnion, call deployDataUnion()
```
const dataUnion = await streamr.deployDataUnion()
```

A Data Union is identified by the address of its smart contract on the Ethereum Mainnet. After the smart contract has been created, the Admin may choose to create an shared secret:

```
const secret = await dataUnion.createSecret(name)
```

The `name` parameter is simply an identifier for the secret. If it is not provided, a randomly generated one will be used. Note that the request must be authenticated using the Ethereum address of the Admin of the Data Union, as described in <Link to={docsLinks.authAndIdentity}>Data Unions Auth & Identity</Link>.

The shared secret allows new members to join the Data Union without explicit approval from the Data Union Admin, to streamline the member joining process.

After the Data Union is deployed, it’s time to list it on the Marketplace. This is typically done using <Link to={docsLinks.dataUnionsInCore}>Core</Link>, but can also be done through the <Link to={docsLinks.api}>HTTP API</Link>.

To create a Data Union instead of a regular Data Product, add `“type”: "DATAUNION"` to the `POST /products` body.

### Observing Data Unions
The Admin can make requests through the Data Unions <Link to={docsLinks.sdk}>client libraries</Link> to understand what’s going on in the Data Union:

```
const stats = await dataUnion.getStats()
```

The returned stats object would look something like:

```
{
  "activeMemberCount": BigNumber(0),
  "inactiveMemberCount": BigNumber(0),
  "joinPartAgentCount": BigNumber,
  "lifetimeMemberEarnings": BigNumber(0),
  "totalEarnings": BigNumber(0),
  "totalWithdrawable": BigNumber(0),
}
```

Other relevant query functions:

```
await dataUnion.getAddress()
await dataUnion.getAdminAddress()
await dataUnion.getSidechainAddress()
await dataUnion.getAdminFee()
await dataUnion.getMemberStats(memberAddress)
await dataUnion.getBalance(memberAddress)
await dataUnion.getWithdrawableEarnings(memberAddress)
```

The Streamr Core app also provides monitoring functions for Admins, showing subscriber numbers, total revenue, join requests and more. <Link to={docsLinks.dataUnionsInCore}>Create a Data Union with Core</Link> provides more information.

Automatically generated API documentation is also available <a href="https://streamr-dev.github.io/streamr-client-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. These docs are generated from the repository TypeScript source code.
