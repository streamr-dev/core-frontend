# Building a simple pub/sub system
Before proceeding with this tutorial, we assume you have connected your Ethereum account and that you have also <Link to={docsLinks.streams}>created your first stream</Link>.

### Publish to a stream
The easiest way to push data to a stream is to use one of our <Link to={docsLinks.sdk}>SDKs</Link>, currently available in <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-javascript">Javascript</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-java">Java</a>. Client libraries for other languages are on the roadmap. Here is an example of publishing data to a stream using Streamr Javascript client.

<CodeSnippet language="javascript" wrapLines showLineNumbers >{ClientPub}</CodeSnippet>

Inside the Core app, you can select the stream and monitor the data preview - your published messages will appear here in real-time.

<Image
  src={StreamEditorPreview}
  highResSrc={StreamEditorPreview2x}
  alt="Stream Editor Preview"
/>

Additionally, you can interact with the Streamr API using any HTTP library of your choice. You will find all the details in the <Link to={docsLinks.api}>API section</Link>. You will need to <Link to={docsLinks.authentication}>authenticate</Link> first before publishing data to any stream.

Once autenticated, youâ€™ll be making a `HTTP POST` request to a URL, which contains your stream ID. Please note that characters in the stream ID should be escaped using url encoding such as changing slashes to `%2F`. The body of the request will be your data payload in JSON. 

<CodeSnippet language="text" wrapLines>{`https://streamr.network/api/v1/streams/MY-STREAM-ID/data`}</CodeSnippet>

You will need to get a session token to publish to a stream - all the different authorization options are explained in the: <Link to={docsLinks.authentication}>API docs</Link>.

<CodeSnippet language="text" wrapLines>{`Authorization: Bearer my-session-token`}</CodeSnippet>

### Subscribe to data
Along with publishing data to a stream, subscribing is best done with one of our <Link to={docsLinks.sdk}>SDKs</Link>. Depending on how you've configured the stream share permissions inside the core app, the subscriber may not need to authenticate. 

Here is the example from the Streamr JavaScript client <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-javascript">readme</a> on how to subscribe to a stream.

<CodeSnippet language="javascript" wrapLines showLineNumbers >{ClientSub}</CodeSnippet>

Congratulations, you've now created a stream, published and subscribed to it ðŸŽ‰
