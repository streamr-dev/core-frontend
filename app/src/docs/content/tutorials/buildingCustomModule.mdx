# Building a custom canvas module

You can easily extend Streamr by writing custom modules in the Java programming language. When a custom module is activated in a canvas, your code is executed as if the module were a part of the built-in machinery. As an alternative to custom code, you can also do abstraction, i.e. reuse existing canvases as modules. 

The **Java module** is the module to use for custom code. Start by creating a new canvas or by opening an existing canvas in the editor. Then insert a JavaModule on the workspace, click on the **Edit Code** button, and a code editor will open in a resizable pop-up window. This is what you'll see:

<CodeSnippet language='java' showLineNumbers wrapLines>{JavaModule}</CodeSnippet>

The Java editor contains a code template that you need to fill in with the appropriate components. A custom module consists of inputs, parameters, outputs, an optional state, and a few specific methods. For the magic to happen, you'll need to specify the inputs and outputs and override the relevant methods. 

The custom module's inputs correspond to the endpoints that receive incoming events. On the canvas, they are shown as small circles on the left-hand side of a module. The outputs correspond to the endpoints which send out computed values after module activation. The output endpoints are shown as small circles on the right-hand side of a module.

Inputs and outputs are defined in the beginning of the code template. To help you get started, there's two lines of commented code near the top.

<CodeSnippet language='java' showLineNumbers wrapLines>{InputsAndOutputs}</CodeSnippet>

If you uncomment those lines (as we've done above), you will get a module with one numerical input and one numerical output. If you want to see the result on the canvas, first click **Apply**, then **Close**. 

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, canvasesStyles.javaModuleOnCanvas)}>
  <img src={JavaModuleOnCanvas} />
</div>

In this example, the inputs belong to the `TimeSeriesInput` class and the outputs to the `TimeSeriesOutput` class. The first argument of an input or output constructor is always `this`, a reference to the current module. The second argument is there for the display name, i.e. a visual label for the endpoint. The variable name on the left-hand side of the assignment can be any valid variable name in Java.

The input and output variables must be unique within a module, but the display names are only labels with no deeper meaning. They don’t have to be unique, and an empty string is a valid name. A common convention is to make the display name equal to the variable name, but this is not a requirement.

You're not limited to numerical endpoints. These are the possible choices for an input event:

- **TimeSeriesInput**: Used for numeric floating point data.
- **BooleanInput**: Used for boolean data.
- **StringInput**: Used for string data.
- **ListInput**: Used for lists (or arrays) of data.
- **MapInput**: Used for key-value pairs.

These are the possible choices for an output event:
- **TimeSeriesOutput**: Used for numeric floating point data.
- **BooleanOutput**: Used for boolean data.
- **StringOutput**: Used for string data.
- **ListOutput**: Used for lists (or arrays) of data.
- **MapOutput**: Used for key-value pairs.

**Parameters are just inputs with default values.** Because a parameter has a default value, there is no need for an incoming connection in the corresponding endpoint. If there is a connection, however, the custom module should take any parameter changes into account at run-time. Possible parameter types are listed below.

- **BooleanParameter**: Used for boolean values (displayed as a drop-down selection).
- **DoubleParameter**: Used for numeric floating point data (displayed as an input).
- **IntegerParameter**: Used for integers (displayed as an input).
- **StringParameter**: Used for strings (displayed as an input).
- **ColorParameter**: Used for RGB colors (displayed as a color selector).

There’s no limitations on the number of incoming and outgoing connections. An an example, the following code would give you three inputs (one of which is a parameter) and two outputs:

<CodeSnippet language='java' showLineNumbers wrapLines>{InputsAndOutputsExample}</CodeSnippet>

### Custom module example

For the sake of illustration, let's create a new JavaModule. It will be similar to the built-in **Sum**, but instead of keeping a running sum, we'll calculate a running product of successive numerical events.

We'll start with the module inputs and outputs. We only need one numerical input and one output here, so we'll just uncomment the relevant lines:

<CodeSnippet language='java' showLineNumbers wrapLines>{DefiningInputsAndOutputs}</CodeSnippet>

In this example the module state is equal to the current value of the cumulative product. We'll call the state `product` and initialise it by the assignment `product = 1` in the `initialize` method. As discussed, we also need to reset the module to its initial state on request. Let's just redo the initial assignment when the `clearState` method is called.

<CodeSnippet language='java' showLineNumbers wrapLines>{ClearState}</CodeSnippet>

All that's left to do is to write the code to multiply the product by the new incoming event, save the state, and submit the output.

<CodeSnippet language='java' showLineNumbers wrapLines>{IncomingEvent}</CodeSnippet>

The code in a JavaModule is compiled and validated when you click the **Apply** button. Unless there's syntax errors in the code, the module is now ready to use. An easy way to generate an input is to connect the **Clock module** to a **Count module**, into a **SendToStream** module. This will input an incrementing number, for every clock tick, 1,2,3 etc. 

This is what the output looks like with sample input data:

<div className={docsStyles.centered}>
  <img src={ModuleExampleOnCanvas} />
</div>
