# Overview
Streamr is an open source, crowdfunded, decentralized platform for real-time data. At its heart is the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href={routes.site.discover.network()}>Streamr Network</a>, which transports <Link to={docsLinks.streams}>streams</Link> of messages from data publishers to subscribers, appearing to the user as a global publish/subscribe messaging service.

It is similar in functionality to message queues, enterprise messaging systems, MQTT brokers, Apache Kafka, or pub/sub cloud messaging services. The key features of such systems, including Streamr, are:
- Publishing messages in order to make them available to subscribers
- Subscribing to messages in order to process them as they occur
- Storing messages for later use

You can create and manage your streams using the <Link to={routes.core()}>Core</Link> user interface. In addition to the Network, the Streamr stack includes a <Link to={docsLinks.marketplace}>Marketplace</Link> for data sharing and monetization.

Streamr utilizes a companion blockchain, currently <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.ethereum.org">Ethereum</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.xdaichain.com">xDai</a>. The blockchain provides users with secure digital identities, enables direct transfers of value in the form of a Streamr-specific cryptocurrency <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href={routes.site.discover.dataToken()}>DATA</a>, and provides a shared ground truth for the network nodes.

### Why use Streamr?
The big difference to comparable data frameworks is that Streamr aims to be decentralized and peer-to-peer. Similar to cloud services, you get on-demand scalability, minimal up-front investment, and benefit from economies of scale. Unlike cloud services, there's no vendor lock-in, no monopolies, no proprietary code, and no need to trust a third party with your data. Decentralized networks are also secure by design, more resilient to attacks and disruptions due to their distributed and peer-to-peer nature. They also benefit from network effectsâ€” as adoption grows, the above points become stronger, a shared standard is formed across industries, and a lot of useful content becomes available from a single source.

Instead of a centralized party, the Network is run by its community of users, and it relies on cryptography to remove the need for trust. This creates a permissionless and neutral network for real-time data, which is highly suitable for use cases such as data sharing, data monetisation, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href={routes.misc.decentralizedWeb()}>decentralized web</a>, extending the capabilities of the underlying internet without compromising its open and decentralized nature.
