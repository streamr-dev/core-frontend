# Glossary

#### Broker node
Broker nodes are the miners in the Streamr Network. They are nodes that constantly monitor Bounties requesting data relaying support in return for DATA tokens.

#### Core app
A user interface for creating and managing streams. [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/streamr-dev/core-frontend).

#### Data Union
A Data Union framework provides a way to collect and package an individuals's real-time data together with others' with rich consent and while distributing a fair share of the revenue back to the users when someone pays to access it.

#### Data Union Admin
The creator of the Data Union, responsible for the joining and parting of members inside the Data Union. Typically takes a percentage cut of data sales to maintain the upkeep of the Data Union and promote the dataset to data marketplaces.

#### Data Union Members
Data Union members publish their data to data streams inside the Data Union with with rich consent. In return they expect monetary rewards, usually in the form of cryptocurrency tokens.

#### Data Union Operator
Otherwise known as the Data Union Admin - The creator of the Data Union, responsible for the joining and parting of members inside the Data Union. Typically takes a percentage cut of data sales to maintain the upkeep of the Data Union and promote the dataset to data marketplaces.

#### Gap fill
Gap fill is a the mechanism of requesting resends of missing messages in a message chain to help achieve delivery completeness. Messages in Streamr streams are chained, allowing for gap detection (detecting missing messages). For example, the client may receive the following sequence (simplified):
- Message 1: Previous message was null
- Message 2: Previous message was Message 1
- Message 5: Previous message was Message 4

The client can now detect that they missed one or more messages that came after Message 2 but before Message 5. They do a "gap fill" to fill the gap, i.e. request a resend of messages from Message 2 (exclusive) up to Message 4 (inclusive).

#### Light node
Light nodes are bundled inside an application that uses Streamr to publish and/or subscibe to streaming data. Light nodes are not extendable like Broker nodes and cannot 'mine' other streams for DATA tokens.

#### Stream
A stream is simply a sequence of data points in time, i.e. an append only log. This is semantically equivalent to *topics* in traditional pub/sub networks. 

#### Storage node
A Streamr network node that subscribes to data with a commitment to store the data and make it available for retrieval requests.

#### Topology
Arrangement on nodes that participate in the dissemination of messages inside a stream.

#### Tracker
Trackers are a type of Streamr node that build and maintain peer to peer stream topologies.
