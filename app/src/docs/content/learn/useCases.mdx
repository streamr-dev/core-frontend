# Use Cases
The Streamr network opens up a world of innovation by connecting unstoppable pub/sub real-time data transport to the vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications.

For example, a stream can receive data from many sources (or publishers), and there can be several listeners who subscribe to a stream in many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many applications. These are just a few examples. There is virtually no limit on the kind, format, or quantity of data you can feed into Streamr, even digital images, streaming video, or other domain-specific data could be pushed into a stream.

### Data Monetisation
Buy and sell access to ethically sourced data streams using <Link to={docsLinks.dataUnions}>Data Unions</Link>. Data Unions are a huge step forward in creating the fair data economy based on ethical first principles. The Streamr Network is idealogically aligned to this cause by providing a permissionlesss and community owned alternative to the data brokering monopolies that exist today.

### DevOps
[Gather metrics from decentralized systems](https://blog.streamr.network/collecting-metrics-data-from-decentralized-systems) such as blockchain networks. Getting detailed real-time information about the state of nodes in your network is incredibly useful to diagnosing issues and improving performance.

### Gaming
The Network is capable of being the real-time networking layer of massive multiplayer games. Light nodes can be run in the browser making for truly decentralized multiplayer experiences.

### IoT messaging
Publish and broadcast messages from any kind of internet-connected device.

Some common use cases include:
- Sensory readings of speed and orientation
- Geolocation
- Ambient temperature and humidity 
- Social media messages
- Stock market events
- Mobile ad impressions

### Networking middleware
Transfer metadata for VoIP or WebRTC signalling.

### Blockchain networking
