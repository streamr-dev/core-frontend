# Use Cases
The Streamr network opens up a world of innovation by connecting unstoppable pub/sub real-time data transport to the vibrant ecosystem of decentralized applications.

For example, a stream can receive data from many sources (or publishers), and there can be several listeners who subscribe to a stream in many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many applications. These are just a few examples. There is virtually no limit on the kind, format, or quantity of data you can feed into Streamr, even digital images, streaming video, or other domain-specific data could be pushed into a stream.

### Data Monetisation
Buy and sell access to ethically sourced data streams using <Link to={docsLinks.dataUnions}>Data Unions</Link>. Data Unions are a huge step forward in creating the fair data economy based on ethical first principles. The Streamr Network is idealogically aligned to this cause by providing an alternative to the data brokering monopolies that exist today.

### DevOps
[Gather metrics from decentralized systems](https://blog.streamr.network/collecting-metrics-data-from-decentralized-systems) such as blockchain networks. Getting detailed real-time information about the state of nodes in your network is incredibly useful to diagnosing issues and improving performance.

### Gaming
The Network is capable of being the real-time networking layer of massive multiplayer games. WebRTC is the most popular data streaming protocol

### IoT messaging
Publish and broadcast messages from any kind of internet-connected device.

Some common use cases include:
- Sensory readings of speed and orientation
- Geolocation
- Ambient temperature and humidity 
- Social media messages
- Stock market events
- Mobile ad impressions

### Networking middleware
Transfer metadata for VoIP or WebRTC signalling.

### Blockchain networking
DDoS resistant block transfer or broadcast signed transactions with low and predictable latency.
