# Using products in Core

Creating and editing marketplace products (paid and free) can be done anytime through the Core app. To create a product, click the creation button below or find it inside <Link to={links.userpages.products}>Core</Link>, once you've logged in.

<Link to={links.marketplace.createProduct}>
    <Button className={productsStyles.createProductButton} color="primary" >
        <Translate value="actionBar.create" />
    </Button>
</Link>

To edit a product, make sure you're logged in as the user that created the product. Then, simply visit the product page where you'll find the **Edit** button available in the toolbar. Please remember if you intend to edit a paid product then you must have your Ethereum wallet connected to your logged in account and available for authentication, to prove ownership of the product. Checkout our <Link to={links.docs.gettingStarted.root}>getting started guide</Link>, for more information about that.

Editing free products can be done at any time but if you need to adjust a paid product's price or beneficiary address, then that action needs to go through the marketplace smart contract. Ethereum Gas will be required for this transaction.
