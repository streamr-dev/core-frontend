# Authentication

A session token is required to make requests to the REST API endpoints or over the websocket protocol. You can obtain a session token by authenticating with either of these three methods:
- [Signing a cryptographic challenge using an Ethereum private key](#challenge)
- [Using a permanent secret API key](#api-key)
- [Using a username and a password](#username-password)

Once you get a session token using one of the above methods, see the section on [using it](#session-token).

<a name="challenge"></a>

### Authenticating with Ethereum

You can use an Ethereum private key to authenticate by signing a challenge with it and providing your Ethereum public address for verification.

Use the `POST` endpoint at `/api/v1/login/challenge/YOUR-PUBLIC-ADDRESS` to generate a random text called a challenge, which looks like the following: 

```
{
    "id": "challenge-id"
    "challenge": "challenge-text-to-be-signed"
    "expires": "2018-10-22T08:38:59Z"
}
```

To authenticate, you must provide a response before the challenge expires. You can do it with a `POST` to `/api/v1/login/response`. It must contain the challenge, the signature and the Ethereum address in the following format:

```
{
    "challenge": {
	    "id": "challenge-id",
	    "challenge": "challenge-text-that-you-signed"
    },
    "signature": "signature-of-the-challenge",
    "address": "your-public-ethereum-address"
}
```

The signature must follow the convention described [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md). The secp256k1 ECDSA algorithm is applied on the keccak256 hash of a string derived from the challenge text:

`sign(keccak256("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + len(challengeText) + challengeText)))`

If the signature is correct, you will receive a [session token](#session-token).

<a name="api-key"></a>

### Authenticating with an API key

Any number of API keys can be attached to your user. You can manage your API keys on your profile page.

When reading from or writing to Streams, you can use a Stream-specific anonymous key instead of your user key to avoid exposing it. Anonymous keys can be managed on the details page of a Stream.

To obtain a [session token](#session-token) using an API key, send a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/login/apikey` endpoint with a JSON body like the one below:

```
{
    "apiKey": "YOUR-API-KEY"
}
```

<a name="username-password"></a>

### Authenticating with a username and a password

You can manage your username and password from your profile page. To obtain a [session token](#session-token) using your username and your password, send them as a `POST` request to the `/api/v1/login/password` endpoint with a JSON body in the following format:

```
{
	"username": "YOUR-USERNAME",
	"password": "YOUR-PASSWORD"
}
```

<a name="session-token"></a>

### Using the session token

By using one of the above authentication methods, you will obtain a session token response in the following format: 

```
{
    "token": "YOUR-SESSION-TOKEN"
    "expires": "2018-10-22T11:38:59Z"
}
```

You can now use this session token to make authenticated requests by including an `Authorization` header on every HTTP request with content as follows:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR-SESSION-TOKEN`

The session token's expiration will be reset on every request to prevent you from getting logged out while using the API. If the token expires, you can obtain a new one exactly as before.
