# Authentication

A session token is required to make requests to the REST API endpoints or over the websocket protocol. You can obtain a session token by signing a cryptographic challenge using an Ethereum private key.

<a name="challenge"></a>

### Authenticating options

The easiest way to authenticate is through the [Streamr Client](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-javascript/) - it will handle the cryptographic signing for you. Client authentication instructions can be found in the [repo readme](https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-javascript/).

If you prefer to use the REST API directly the you can use an Ethereum private key to authenticate by signing a challenge with it and providing your Ethereum public address for verification.

Use the `POST` endpoint at `/api/v1/login/challenge/YOUR-PUBLIC-ADDRESS` to generate a random text called a challenge, which looks like the following: 

```
{
    "id": "challenge-id"
    "challenge": "challenge-text-to-be-signed"
    "expires": "2018-10-22T08:38:59Z"
}
```

To authenticate, you must provide a response before the challenge expires. You can do it with a `POST` to `/api/v1/login/response`. It must contain the challenge, the signature and the Ethereum address in the following format:

```
{
    "challenge": {
	    "id": "challenge-id",
	    "challenge": "challenge-text-that-you-signed"
    },
    "signature": "signature-of-the-challenge",
    "address": "your-public-ethereum-address"
}
```

The signature must follow the convention described [here](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-712.md). The secp256k1 ECDSA algorithm is applied on the keccak256 hash of a string derived from the challenge text:

`sign(keccak256("\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n" + len(challengeText) + challengeText)))`

If the signature is correct, you will receive a [session token](#session-token).

<a name="session-token"></a>

### Using the session token

By using one of the above authentication methods, you will obtain a session token response in the following format: 

```
{
    "token": "YOUR-SESSION-TOKEN"
    "expires": "2018-10-22T11:38:59Z"
}
```

You can now use this session token to make authenticated requests by including an `Authorization` header on every HTTP request with content as follows:

`Authorization: Bearer YOUR-SESSION-TOKEN`

The session token's expiration will be reset on every request to prevent you from getting logged out while using the API. If the token expires, you can obtain a new one exactly as before.
