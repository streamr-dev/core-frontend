# API overview

Streamr provides a set of APIs for easy integration with other systems. The APIs cover <Link to={docsLinks.authentication}>Authentication</Link>, data input, data output, and managing various resources within Streamr (such as Data Unions, streams and products).

There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">REST</a>ful HTTP endpoints that can be accessed using any HTTP library with ease. You can explore these endpoints using the <Link to={docsLinks.apiExplorer}>API Explorer</Link>. You can expect:
- Predictable resource-oriented URL endpoints
- Form-encoded request bodies
- JSON-encoded responses
- Standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

There are two APIs for requesting data from Streamr into external applications: the websocket-based streaming API, and the HTTP API. For efficiently publishing and subscribing to data in real-time, using the websocket API is recommended.

The streaming API can be used to control external applications using real-time events from Streamr. For example, you could push real-time stock prices into a mobile app, or update player positions in a multiplayer game. Or you could implement a thermostat by controlling warming or cooling based on a temperature measurement. The streaming API pushes new events to subscribed clients immediately when they become available.

Using a client library is recommended for most tasks and integrations:

- <a href="https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-javascript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript client library (official)</a> 
- client works in the browser as well as node.js. The package is available on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamr-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">npm</a>.
- <a href="https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Java client library (official)</a>
- <a href="https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-client-python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python client library (community)</a>

If you'd like to contribute a client library and get it listed here, check out our section on <Link to={docsLinks.technicalNotes}>contributing</Link>.

### API behaviour

The body of the request should be a JSON object, encoded in UTF-8, containing the key-value pairs representing your data.

**Response codes**

Code | Description
---- | -----------
200  | Success (the response is empty)
400  | Invalid request
401  | Permission denied
403  | Authentication failed
404  | Stream not found
500  | Unexpected error

### Data output over websocket

The websocket protocol is easiest to use with one of the available client libraries. If there isn't a client library available for your language, you can dive into the details of the <a href="https://github.com/streamr-dev/streamr-specs/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">websocket protocol</a>.
