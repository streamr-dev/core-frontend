## Introduction to Streamr User Pages

Once you create an account or sign in to the Streamr app, you will find yourself in the user page area. Added with the Q1 2019 Editor update, this feature gives you access to all the files you can create with Streamr; streams, canvases, dashboards, Marketplace products and purchases, plus a blockchain transaction history and application preferences. 

It will keep track of funds earned on the marketplace, and allow you to create, edit, share, and manage files across the Streamr app. From anywhere in the Streamr app, you can choose Home from the top menu to get you back to your user page.

When you first sign in, you will find some example content in each of the tabs, designed to help you understand how to use the various parts of the app. You can also find some help via the **? icon** at bottom right, which will link you to more detailed introductions to each part of the app

## Page Overview

Filter and Sort
If you create a lot of streams, canvases, dashboards or products, or buy a lot of products from the Marketplace, you might find the filtering option handy. It works on a per-tab basis, and will live filter the content of that tab, just click the icon at left. 

If you want to change the default sorting (chronological) for that view, you can do so with the dropdown at the right side.

#### Tile and List options

For the views that have tiles (canvases, dashboards, products, purchases), there is a contextual menu accessed on hover via the meatball icon. Function varies depending on tile type, but generally you can delete, share and open your files, plus other functions like grabbing the direct URL for a canvas, for example.

Items in list views (Streams, Transactions) also have options, behind meatball menus at far right of the list item. Transactions options can get you Etherscan links or copy the transaction hash to your clipboard, while Stream options include adding to a canvas, copying the stream ID or snippet and more.

#### Create

All the views that allow file creation have a button on the top right for this. You can create a new canvas or dashboard in the Editor,  a real-time data stream or a Marketplace product in this way. 

#### Profile and Balance

If you have added an Ethereum address to Streamr, your DATA balance, if any, will be shown near your profile information. You can add a profile image here if you wish.

#### Settings

The icon at top right of the nav bar gives you access to your account settings page, which allows you to change your profile information, ethereum and email addresses, API keys and more.

It also provides access to the create stream flow, where you can add your own realtime streams to your account. New streams created will show up automatically. The streams status is also shown at right. If you’ve fixed a problem with a stream and the system hasn’t noticed it yet, you can manually refresh the stream via the meatball menu.
