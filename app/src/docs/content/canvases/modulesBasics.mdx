# Using modules - basics

A module is close akin to what you'd call a function, subroutine, procedure, or a method in various programming languages. In Streamr, modules are specialised computation units for handling streaming realtime data. A module processes its inputs as soon as it is activated by the arrival of a new event. The module may have one or more outputs, or it may take care of some side effect instead.

<img
  src={Modules}
  srcSet={`${Modules2x} 2x`}
  alt="Modules"
/>

A module has an internal state, and it can and typically will update that state when it is executed. How this is done depends on the particular module. The statefulness is an important feature and one the key ingredients in realtime stream processing.

You'll find all the built-in components in the **module browser**. If you already know the name of the module you need, type its name in the search box, then select the right module or stream, or drag it into your workspace. You can hide and show the browser using the + button on the toolbar.

<div className={docsStyles.mobileImageStretch}>

    alt="Module Browser"
    />
</div>
<span className={docsStyles.caption}>The module browser. Browse or search for modules and streams.</span>

### Inputs, outputs, and parameters

A module can have inputs, outputs, and parameters. Whilst a module does not need to have any inputs or outputs, useful modules will typically allow for either incoming or outgoing data (and usually both). 

When placed on a canvas, the inputs are shown as circular connectors along the left-hand side of the module. The outputs are shown as connectors along the right-hand side.

Many modules have parameters which control their operation. Module parameters can be hardcoded, but their values are typically not immutable. If a parameter can be modified at run-time, there is an associated parameter editable input inside the module.

<div className={docsStyles.mobileImageStretch}>
    <img
    src={ModuleAnatomy}
    srcSet={`${ModuleAnatomy2x} 2x`}
    alt="Module anatomy"
    />
    <span>The basic elements of a canvas module</span>
</div>

As an example, the RoundToStep module has three inputs, two parameters, and one output. The first two inputs correspond to the module’s parameters, i.e. precision and mode. The last input is a numeric value which will be rounded with the specified precision in the direction specified by the mode. The module output is equal to the rounded input.Inputs, outputs, and parameters can be renamed by double clicking on them and typing new text. Renaming has no bearing on functionality.

    <img
    src={RoundToStep2x}
    alt="Round to step module"
    />
</div>

### Adding streams
When you place a stream on the canvas, you effectively subscribe to a realtime data source. To add a stream, just start typing its name in module browser search. The stream name will autocomplete as you type. Realtime events are now available at the output endpoints.

<img
    src={AddingStreams}
    srcSet={`${AddingStreams2x} 2x`}
    alt="Adding streams"
/>

You can move modules around on the workspace as you wish, the placement of a module has no impact on functionality. For clarity, you may want to design the canvas so that module placement reflects the data flow from the input streams through the modules.

As a simple example, here's a canvas consisting of one stream and a chart module connected together. When you run the canvas, the events flow from the stream to the chart, and the chart draws the data points as they arrive.

<img
    src={Chart}
    srcSet={`${Chart2x} 2x`}
    alt="Chart"
/>

### Sending data to a stream

Use the SendToStream module if you want to send data that has been generated inside the canvas, into a stream. Inside the module, start typing the name of your stream and it will autocomplete for you. Remember to configure the fields of your stream before using this module as the module's inputs are defined by it's fields. Learn more about fields in the <Link to={links.docs.streams.root}>streams docs</Link>.

<img
    src={SendToStream}
    srcSet={`${SendToStream2x} 2x`}
    alt="Send To Stream module"
/>

### Connecting modules

A data flow between two modules — or a data flow between a stream and a module — is created by drawing a connection from an outgoing endpoint (port) to an incoming endpoint. You can create as many outgoing connections as you wish. You can only have one incoming connection per an endpoint.

Along with **inputs** and **outputs**, there are also **parameters**. **Parameters are just inputs with default values**. Because a parameter has a default value, there is no need for an incoming connection in the corresponding endpoint.

<img
    src={ConnectingModules}
    srcSet={`${ConnectingModules2x} 2x`}
    alt="Connecting Modules"
/>

You can only connect endpoints with compatible data types. As you hold your mouse down, compatible connections will glow green and incompatible connections glow red. For instance, you cannot create a connection which feeds string events to an endpoint where numerical events are expected. There are conversion modules such as StringToNumber which can help when you get stuck with the wrong data type.

All connections are unidirectional, i.e. the data always flows from an output to one or more inputs in one direction only. The modules form a directed graph. Feedback loops are discouraged, but you can create them if you really want.

<div className={docsStyles.captionedImage}>
    <img
        src={SamplerModule}
        srcSet={`${SamplerModule2x} 2x`}
        alt="Sampler Module"
    />
    <span>Right-click to access the port menu</span>
</div>

You can alter the endpoint of an existing connection by dragging it to another input endpoint. If you instead drop the endpoint in an empty area in the workspace, the connection is cleared. Right clicking on top of a module port will bring up a pop-up menu with the option to disconnect all incoming connections to the module.
