# Intro to Core

Streamr <Link to={links.userpages.main}>Core</Link> is the collection of open source applications developed and supported by Streamr that help you create, process, visualise and sell your real-time data. 

Essentially, Core is the UI toolkit for working with Streams, Canvases, Dashboards, and Products on the Streamr Platform.

All you need to get started using <Link to={links.userpages.main}>Core</Link> is a <Link to={links.docs.gettingStarted.root}>Streamr Account</Link>.
