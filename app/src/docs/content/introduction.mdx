## Streamr Tech Stack

### Realtime Engine
Processing raw data needs an Engine because it needs to be aggregated, filtered, or combined with other data to extract its value. Our Engine is built to deal with high volumes of information and accept data from a wide variety of sources including financial exchanges, IoT devices and social media.

### Streamr Editor

Connect and create with the tools we’ve made for you. Our visual programming environment makes it easy to build and test data-driven dApps. Combine data streams, smart contracts, visualisations, and off-chain analytics modules and execute your process in realtime on the Streamr Engine.

### Data Marketplace

A storefront for the world’s data streams. It categorises, bundles, sorts and showcases 
all available data, both free and commercial on the Streamr Network, and acts as a single common interface for bringing together data buyers and sellers, who transact using $DATA. And we don’t take a transaction fee.

### Streamr Network

Your realtime data will travel through our decentralised peer-to-peer Network, hosted 
on computers around the globe. Our scalable, low-latency transport layer built for realtime dApps as well as data streams on the Marketplace will be supported by nodes who earn $DATA in exchange for the bandwidth and validation they provide.
