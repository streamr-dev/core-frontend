Listen to MQTT messages, output them as strings. If message is JSON, a JsonParser module can be used to transform the string into a map, and GetMultiFromMap module to extract values from the map.

**Connecting to MQTT without certificate**. Give URL address as mqtt://service.com or tcp://service.com. Add topic and username and password if needed.

**Connecting to MQTT with certificate**. Give URL address as ssl://service.com. Add topic and username and password if needed. Select certificate type to be .crt and paste your certificate to text area.
