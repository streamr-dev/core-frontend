Reads values from the selected stream into your canvas. The module will reveal its outputs based on the fields configured for the selected stream. Ensure the selected stream has some fields configured, otherwise the module will not show any outputs. 

To select a stream, click into the value input from the dropdown menu containing all the streams you have permission to access.
