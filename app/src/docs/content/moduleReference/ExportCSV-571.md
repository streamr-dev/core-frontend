[comment]: # (UtilsCanvasModule)
Generates a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file from event data that flows into this moduleâ€™s inputs. 

The file download link becomes available once the canvas has been started, and then stopped. You may wish to connect the inputs of this module to a `stream` module with real-time data flowing.
