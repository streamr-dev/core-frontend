This module allows you to reuse a canvas saved into the archive as a module in your current canvas. This enables reuse and abstraction of functionality and helps keep your canvases tidy and modular. Any parameters, inputs or outputs you export will be visible on the module. You can export endpoints by right-clicking on them and selecting "Toggle export".
