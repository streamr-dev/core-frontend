Outputs a certain value at a certain time. E.g. Every day from 10:00 to 14:00 the module outputs value 1 and otherwise value 0. If more than one rule are active at the same time, the value from the rule with the highest priority (the highest rule in the list) is sent. If no rule is active, the default value will be sent out.
