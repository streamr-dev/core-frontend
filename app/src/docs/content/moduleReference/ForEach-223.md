This module allows you to reuse a canvas saved into the archive as a module in your current canvas. A separate canvas instance will be created for each distinct key, which enables ForEach-like behavior to be implemented. The canvas instances will also retain state as expected. Any parameters, inputs or outputs you export will be visible on the module. You can export endpoints by right-clicking on them and selecting "Toggle export".
