Calls an Ethereum smart contract. First, connect Ethereum contract into **contract**Â input. You can write your own using SolidityModule, or pick a template such as PayByUse. Second, choose the **function** you want to call from the dropdown. There are two kinds of functions calls, constant function calls that return results directly, and transactions that return values through events that the function call invokes. The contract must be deployed before this module can activate.
