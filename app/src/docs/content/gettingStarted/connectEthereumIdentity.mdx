### Connecting your Ethereum identity on Streamr

You will need to have an Ethereum account on Streamr if you want to publish or buy a paid product on the Marketplace. It is optional, but recommended if you want to enjoy the full Streamr experience.

### How to Connect your Ethereum Account

Checkout our <Link to={links.docs.introduction}>intro docs</Link> if you'd like to understand more about what Ethereum is and what it means to have an account on Ethereum.

The easiest way to get started is through the free and open source Chrome browser extension, <a href="https://metamask.io" target="blank">Metamask</a>. Metamask is also <a href="https://mobile.metamask.io/" target="blank">available on Android and Apple mobile devices</a>. The explainer video below will help you understand how to use Metamask.

<div className={docsStyles.playerWrapper}>
    <ReactPlayer
        controls
        className={docsStyles.reactPlayer}
        url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGUC9JAAw8"
        width="100%"
        height="100%"
    />
</div>

Once you have your Ethereum account on Metamask, you can connect it to Streamr. There's two ways to do it:

#### Option 1) No Streamr account yet

If you haven't created an account yet on Streamr, you can use your Ethereum account to create one.

Go to the <Link to={links.internalLogin}>login page</Link> and click 'Sign in with Ethereum'.

<Link to={links.internalLogin}>
  <div className={docsStyles.centered}>
    <img src={SignupScreen} />
  </div>
</Link>

A popup will ask you to sign a message with your Ethereum account to prove ownership, click 'Sign'.

<Link to={links.internalLogin}>
  <div className={docsStyles.centered}>
    <img src={EthereumLogin} />
  </div>
</Link>

You're done! ðŸŽ‰ 

There's no need to remember passwords anymore - your Ethereum account doubles up as your Streamr identity!

Checkout some of the suggestions below to get your feet wet inside the Streamr Platform.


#### Option 2) You already have a Streamr account

If you already have a Streamr account, go to the *Ethereum accounts* section of your <Link to={`${links.userpages.profile}#ethereum-accounts`}>profile page</Link>.

Click **Add new address** to attach your address to your Streamr account. 

<Link to={links.userpages.profile}>
  <div className={docsStyles.centered}>
    <img src={EthereumAccts} />
  </div>
</Link>

Choosing a memorable name for each address is recommended if you have many Ethereum accounts!

<Link to={links.userpages.profile}>
  <div className={docsStyles.centered}>
    <img src={NameEthereum} />
  </div>
</Link>

You will be asked for a signature to prove ownership of the address.

<Link to={links.userpages.profile}>
  <div className={docsStyles.centered}>
    <img src={EthereumSign} />
  </div>
</Link>

You're done! ðŸŽ‰
