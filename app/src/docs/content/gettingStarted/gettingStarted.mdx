# Getting Started
Welcome to Streamr! To get a feel for what Streamr is, check out our <Link to={links.docs.introduction.root}>intro docs</Link>.
The first thing you'll want to get is a Streamr account. You can do that <Link to={links.internalLogin}>here</Link>. Creating an account requires either an Email address or a Web3 Ethereum wallet, e.g. <a href="https://metamask.io" target="blank">Metamask</a>.

### Get your API keys
After creating your Streamr account, visit your profile settings page to reveal your API keys. These keys grant you access to read and write to the streams you create and are your means of authentication when using the Streamr API.

### Ethereum identity on Streamr
You will need to have an Ethereum account on Streamr if you want to publish or buy a paid product on the Marketplace. It is optional, but recommended if you want to enjoy the full Streamr experience.

### Connect your Ethereum Account
Checkout our intro docs if you'd like to understand more about what Ethereum is and what it means to have an account on Ethereum.

The easiest way to get started is through the free and open source Chrome browser extension, Metamask. Metamask is also available on Android and Apple mobile devices. The explainer video below will help you understand how to use Metamask.

<div className={docsStyles.playerWrapper}>
    <ReactPlayer
        controls
        className={docsStyles.reactPlayer}
        url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGUC9JAAw8"
        width="100%"
        height="100%"
    />
</div>

Once you have your Ethereum account on Metamask, you can connect it to Streamr. There are two ways to do it, depending whether you already have a Streamr account or not. **If you haven't created an account yet, you can use your Ethereum account to create one**. Simply go to the <Link to={links.internalLogin}>login page</Link> and click **Sign in with Ethereum**. A popup will ask you to sign a message with your Ethereum account to prove ownership, click **Sign**.

        src={SignInWithEth}
        srcSet={`${SignInWithEth2x} 2x`}
        alt="Ethereum sign in"
      />

You're done! ðŸŽ‰ There's no need to remember passwords anymore - your Ethereum account doubles up as your Streamr identity! Check out some of the suggestions below to get your feet wet inside the Streamr Platform.

**In case you already have a Streamr account, this is the way to go**. Head to the Ethereum accounts section of your profile page, and click **Add new address** to attach your address to your Streamr account.

      <img
        src={EthIdentities}
        srcSet={`${EthIdentities2x} 2x`}
        alt="Ethereum identities"
      />

Choosing a memorable name for each address is recommended if you have many Ethereum accounts. You will be asked to sign a challenge to prove ownership of the address, and then you're done! ðŸŽ‰
