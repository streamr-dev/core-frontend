# Getting Started
Welcome to Streamr! To get a feel for what Streamr is, check out our <Link to={docsLinks.introduction}>intro docs</Link>. 

To get started, you'll want to login to Streamr. Your Streamr account is your Ethereum account - there's no email registration, simply <Link to={routes.auth.login()}>login</Link> with your Web3 Ethereum wallet such as <a href="https://metamask.io" target="blank">Metamask</a>.

<Warning>

**Upcoming deprecations and breaking changes**
- **Authenticating with an API key has been deprecated.**
- **Support for email/password authentication will be dropped on December 31st 2020. Cryptographic keys/wallets will be the only supported method.**

</Warning>

### Connect your Ethereum Account
Checkout our intro docs if you'd like to understand more about what Ethereum is and what it means to have an account on Ethereum.

The easiest way to get started is through the free and open source Chrome browser extension, Metamask. Metamask is also available on Android and Apple mobile devices. The explainer video below will help you understand how to use Metamask.

<div className={docsStyles.playerWrapper}>
    <ReactPlayer
        controls
        className={docsStyles.reactPlayer}
        url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGUC9JAAw8"
        width="100%"
        height="100%"
    />
</div>

Once you have your Ethereum account on Metamask, you can connect it to Streamr. A popup will ask you to sign a message with your Ethereum account to prove ownership, click **Sign**.

You're done! ðŸŽ‰ There's no need to remember passwords anymore - your Ethereum account doubles up as your Streamr identity! Check out some of the suggestions below to get your feet wet inside the Streamr Platform.

**In case you already have a Streamr account, this is the way to go**. Head to the Ethereum accounts section of your profile page, and click **Add new address** to attach your address to your Streamr account.

Choosing a memorable name for each address is recommended if you have many Ethereum accounts. You will be asked to sign a challenge to prove ownership of the address, and then you're done! ðŸŽ‰
