# Getting Started
Welcome to Streamr! To get a feel for what Streamr is, check out our <Link to={docsLinks.introduction}>intro docs</Link>. 

To get started, you'll want to login to Streamr. Your Streamr account is your Ethereum account - there's no email registration, simply <Link to={routes.auth.login()}>login</Link> with your Web3 Ethereum wallet such as <a href="https://metamask.io" target="blank">Metamask</a>.

### Connect your Ethereum Account
The easiest way to get started is through the free and open source Chrome browser extension, Metamask. Metamask is also available on Android and Apple mobile devices. The explainer video below will help you understand how to use Metamask.

<div className={docsStyles.playerWrapper}>
    <ReactPlayer
        controls
        className={docsStyles.reactPlayer}
        url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGUC9JAAw8"
        width="100%"
        height="100%"
    />
</div>

Once you have your Ethereum account on Metamask, you can connect it to Streamr. A popup will ask you to sign a message with your Ethereum account to prove ownership, click **Sign**.
