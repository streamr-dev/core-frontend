# Publish and Subscribe
Bring your data to Streamr in the way that works best for you â€” as a JS library within your app, or from any application/langauge via MQTT, HTTP or Websocket.

### Publish and Subscribe via JS library
The Streamr client library wraps a Streamr light node for publishing and subscribing to data, and contains convenience functions for creating and managing streams. You can insert a node into any application where JavaScript runs, including the browser.

Checkout the docs section for <Link to={docsLinks.usingALightNode}>Using a light node</Link>.

### Publish and subscribe via MQTT, HTTP or Websocket
You will need to run a Broker node and interface to it with either MQTT, HTTP or Websocket. Checkout the docs section for <Link to={docsLinks.connectingApplications}>Connecting Applications</Link>. 

### Data preview
Inside the <Link to={routes.streams.index()}>Core app</Link>, you can select the stream and monitor the data preview - your published messages will appear here in real-time.
