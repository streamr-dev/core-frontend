## Work with streams in Core
Streamr Core provides you with the tools to create, edit, share and delete your streams as well as view and inspect the streams you have purchased on the Marketplace.

### Overview of your streams
Head over to the <Link to={links.userpages.streams}>Streams page</Link> to see an overview of your subscribed streams. The list includes streams you have created and streams that you have purchased on the Marketplace.

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, streamsStyles.streamListing)}>
  <img src={StreamListing} />
</div>

This stream listing page gives an indication for when data was last pushed to each stream and uses traffic light indicators show the health of each stream, at a glance.

| Color        | Status                           |
| ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Green        | Stream is receiving data         |
| Red          | Stream is not receiving data     |

Clicking on a stream will open the stream editor. You may only edit streams that you have created or have explicit permission to edit.

By clicking on the more options icon you may access advanced features for each stream, such as stream sharing and code snippets.
A new stream can be created by the clicking the **Create Stream** button.

### Editing a stream
The stream editor provides basic tools for setting up, inspecting and editing your stream. Below is a run-down of each stream editor section.

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, streamsStyles.streamDetails)}>
  <img src={StreamDetails} />
</div>

#### Details section
The details section provides basic information about your stream. 

- The stream name is used to identify your stream in the Core app.
- The stream description can be used to offer more information about your stream and the kind of data it contains.
- The stream ID is the unique identifier for your stream and is needed when interacting with the <Link to={links.docs.SDKs}>Streamr SDKs</Link>.

#### Configure section
In this section you can configure stream fields and their data types. All fields have a name and a data type.
The Autodetect feature can be used to automatically deduce fields from the stream's last received message.
It is possible to manually correct the data types if automatic detection is not suitable for your stream.

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, streamsStyles.streamConfigure)}>
  <img src={StreamConfigure} />
</div>

| Setting                                             | Explanation                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Always try to autoconfigure field names and types   | Streamr will try to automatically configure field names and types on the very first message the stream receives |
| Require all messages in this stream to be signed    | Streamr will not accept messages that are not signed                                                            |

#### Preview section
This section is used to preview data flowing into the stream. Use the live inspector to make sure your stream is receiving data and it is correctly formatted.

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, streamsStyles.streamPreview)}>
  <img src={StreamPreview} />
</div>

#### API Access section
Here you can manage API keys for your stream. Keys generated here grant access to only this stream and can have either read or write access.
These keys can also be removed if for example, the key has been compromised.

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, streamsStyles.streamApiAccess)}>
  <img src={StreamApiAccess} />
</div>

#### Historical Data section
This section contains the stream's historical data storage settings and includes tools to add or remove historical data from the stream. 

<div className={cx(docsStyles.centered, streamsStyles.streamHistorical)}>
  <img src={StreamHistorical} />
</div>

You can add new data to the stream by uploading a CSV file and you can delete existing historical data from the stream by choosing an inclusive date range. 

The historical data storage period determines how many days your data is retained before it will be removed automatically from the Streamr network. The default period is 365 days.
