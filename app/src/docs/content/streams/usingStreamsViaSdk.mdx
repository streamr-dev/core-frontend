# Work with streams via SDKs

The easiest way to work with streams is to use the JavaScript client, which works in Node.js as well as the browser. See the <Link to={docsLinks.sdk}>SDKs section</Link> for the official and community-maintained client libraries available for various languages.

### Authentication

When reading from or writing to streams, you need to provide a session token, or authenticate with an Ethereum account. To read more about obtaining a session token, refer to the <Link to={docsLinks.authentication}>Authentication section of the API docs</Link>.

### Subscribing to real-time events in a stream

By subscribing to Streams, your application gets immediately notified about new events in the stream.

#### JavaScript
<CodeSnippet language="javascript">{SubscribeJavascriptClient}</CodeSnippet>

#### Java
<CodeSnippet language="java">{SubscribeJavaClient}</CodeSnippet>

### Publishing events to Streams

#### JavaScript
<CodeSnippet language="javascript">{PublishJavascriptClient}</CodeSnippet>

#### Java
Events in Streams are key-value pairs, represented in Java as Map objects. Below is an example of creating an event payload and publishing it into a Stream.
