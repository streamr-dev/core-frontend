# Work with streams via API

While the Core UI can do just about everything you'd want to do with streams, sometimes the using the API directly is preferred.

### Data output over HTTP

Events in streams can be queried via HTTP. Example using `curl`:

<CodeSnippet language="bash">
    {`curl -i -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer MY-SESSION-TOKEN" -d '{"foo":"hello","bar":24.5}' https://streamr.network/api/v1/streams/MY-STREAM-ID/data`}
</CodeSnippet>

The following endpoint would return the 5 most recent messages in a stream (or to be more precise, the default partition 0 of a stream):

<CodeSnippet language="text">{`https://streamr.network/api/v1/streams/{id}/data/partitions/0/last?count=5`}</CodeSnippet>

The HTTP API covers session management, data input, data output, and managing Streamr resources. The endpoints allow you to list, create, read, update and delete the resources.
