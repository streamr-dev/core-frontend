# Intro to streams
All of the data in the Streamr network is contained inside individual streams. A stream is simply a sequence of data points in time. The data may originate, for example from machines on the factory floor, sensors in a smart city, in-house databases or systems, or from commercial streaming data feeds.

Streams have the following properties:
- Any kind of real-time data can be stored in it.
- The data will always be retrieved in the correct order.
- The data is persisted on the Streamr network and identifiable by unique ID.

Some common use cases for streams:
- Sensory readings of speed and orientation
- Geolocation
- Ambient temperature and humidity 
- Social media messages
- Stock market events
- Mobile ad impressions

These are just a few examples. There is virtually no limit on the kind, format, or quantity of data you can feed into Streamr, even digital images, streaming video, or other domain-specific data could be pushed into a stream.

Streams implement a publish-subscribe paradigm, or pub/sub for short. A stream can receive data from many sources (or publishers), and there can be several listeners who subscribe to a stream. There are several variations on the possible pub/sub topologies, such as many-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. Streamr supports all of these.

If you want to try it out already, you can dive into our tutorial on <Link to={docsLinks.buildingPubSubTutorial}>building a simple pub/sub system</Link> with Streamr.

### Example stream
Here’s an example of what a small part of a stream could look like. Each row shows one data point, and the columns correspond to the timestamp followed by two data fields, a measurement of the operating temperature and the number of rotations per minute (RPM).

| Timestamp                | Temperature   | RPM  |
| ------------------------ |:-------------:| ----:|
| 2019-08-01 11:30:01.012  | 312.56        | 3550 |
| 2019-08-01 11:30:02.239  | 312.49        | 3549 |
| 2019-08-01 11:30:04.105  | 312.42        | 3543 |
| 2016-02-01 11:30:08.122  | 313.21        | 3565 |
| 2016-02-01 11:30:11.882  | 317.45        | 3602 |

### Stream data fields
A field is a kind of placeholder for an individual piece of data, from a single data point. Each data point contains at least one data field, but you can have as many fields per data point as required.

For example, here's a data point in a stock market stream.

```
{
  "Symbol": "PFFT",
  "EventType": 1,
  "OrderId": 6454321,
  "Direction": "Up",
  "Trade": {"Price": 118.55, "Size": 100},
  "Ask": [
          {"Price": 118.6, "Size": 22500},
          {"Price": 118.65, "Size": 18000},
          {"Price": 118.7, "Size": 13000},
          {"Price": 118.8, "Size": 8000},
          {"Price": 119, "Size": 45000}
          ],
  "Bid": [
          {"Price": 118.5, "Size": 16500},
          {"Price": 118.45, "Size": 11000},
          {"Price": 118.4, "Size": 14200},
          {"Price": 118.2, "Size": 19000},
          {"Price": 118, "Size": 50000}
        ]
}
```

Given the structure of this data point, the stream's fields could be configured as follows:

| Field                | Field type    |
| -------------------- |:-------------:|
| Symbol               | String        |
| EventType            | Number        |
| OrderId              | Number        |
| Direction            | String        |
| Trade                | Object        |
| Ask                  | List          |
| Bid                  | List          |

### Data field types
There’s a number of built-in data types that can be used in a stream. These are:

**Number** is a numeric data type internally stored as a double precision (64-bit) float.

**Boolean** is a logical data type with two possible values, True and False. In Streamr, a numeric value exactly equal to one represents logical truth. Anything else is interpreted as a logical falsehood.

**String** is a sequence of zero or more alphabetical characters.

**Object** is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key is a string, and the value can be of any built-in data type (even another object). Object is equivalent to Java's 'Map'.

**List** is an ordered collection of zero or more elements. List is equivilent to an array.

Field types can be freely mixed in a single data point. And you can freely add new fields to an existing stream; you don’t have to know what fields you might eventually need. A single data point can be of any size within reason, and a stream can grow indefinitely when extended by new data points.
