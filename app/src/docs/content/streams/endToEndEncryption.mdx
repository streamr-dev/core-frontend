# End-to-end encryption
Confidentiality of events published on a stream can be guaranteed with end-to-end encryption. The publisher decides on a AES-256 symmetric group key and encrypts the messages in CTR mode before publishing them to the network. The subscribers must know this symmetric group key in order to decrypt the data.

Currently, the symmetric key must be shared between the publisher and the subscribers in a secure way outside of the Streamr Network. The publisher can pass group keys per stream as parameters and the subscriber can pass group keys per stream and per publisher as parameters. Later it will be possible to use a secure key-exchange protocol directly in the Streamr Network.

In order to prevent new subscribers to eavesdrop and then decrypt past messages published before the start of their subscription, the publisher can decide at any time to update the symmetric group key by sending a new key concatenated with an event and encrypted with the current key:
```
// normal case when creating a ciphertext of an event 'm1' with a key 'k1'
c1 = AES_encrypt(m1, k1)
// when updating the key to 'k2', current subscribers will recover 'k2'
c2 = AES_encrypt(m2 + k2, k1)
// the next messages can be encrypted with 'k2', new subscribers obtain 'k2' but not 'k1' so they cannot decrypt m1 and m2
c3 = AES_encrypt(m3, k2)
```

Both the Javascript and the Java SDKs support this key update mechanism. It can be triggered by calling the `publish` method with a new symmetric group key as parameter.

<Warning>

The current stable version of the Streamr Client is `5.x` (at the time of writing, December 2021) which is connected to the [Corea Network](https://streamr.network/roadmap). The Brubeck Network Streamr Client is the [6.0.0-alpha.19](https://www.npmjs.com/package/streamr-client/v/6.0.0-alpha.19) build along with the `testnet` builds of the Broker node. The developer experience of the two networks is the same, however, the `6.0.0-alpha.19` client also runs as a light node in the network, whereas the `5.x` era client communicates to a Streamr run node, remotely. When the Streamr Network transitions into the Brubeck era (ETA Jan/Feb 2022), data guarantees of `5.x` clients will need to be reassessed. Publishing data to the Brubeck network will only be visible in the [Brubeck Core UI](https://brubeck.streamr.network). The Marketplace, Core app and CLI tool are currently all configured to interact with the Corea Network only. Take care not to mix networks during this transition period.
