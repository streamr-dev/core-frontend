# Data storage
The data in the Streamr Network is stored in storage nodes. You can enable data storage on your streams to retain historical data in one or more geographic locations of your choice. You can also choose how long to store your streamâ€™s historical data before auto-deletion.

By default, storage is not enabled and you must opt-in by selecting a storage node inside the Core UI. To programmatically do this, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/streamr-dev/network-monorepo/tree/main/packages/client#storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Streamr Client readme</a>
