# Streamr APIs
Streamr provides a set of APIs for easy integration with other systems. The APIs cover authentication, data input, data output, and managing various resources within Streamr (such as Streams, Canvases, Products, and Dashboards).

There are RESTful HTTP endpoints that can be accessed using any HTTP library with ease. You can explore these endpoints using the API explorer.

For efficiently publishing and subscribing to data in realtime, using the websocket API is recommended.

### Client libraries
For easy usage of both the HTTP and websocket APIs, there are official and community-maintained client libraries available for various languages:

- JavaScript (official) - client works in the browser as well as node.js. The package is available on npm.
- Java (official) - work-in-progress but already implements the most important set of functionality.
- Python (community) - coming soon

If you'd like to contribute a client library and get it listed here, please get in touch on Telegram, Reddit or email!

## Authentication
A session token is required to make requests to the REST API endpoints or over the websocket protocol. You can obtain a session token by authenticating either using an API key or by signing a cryptographic challenge using an Ethereum private key.

Once you get a session token using one of the below methods, see the section on using it.
